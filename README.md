# Surface_Crack_Detection

This project is based on a dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/arunrk7/surface-crack-detection

This dataset contains images of various concrete surfaces with and without cracks. The data is processed and model is built, which can predict if an input image surface has cracks or no.
